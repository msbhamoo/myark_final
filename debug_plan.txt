const admin = require('firebase-admin');
const { getFirestore } = require('firebase-admin/firestore');

// Initialize Firebase Admin (assuming it's already initialized in the app, but here we need a standalone script or reuse app context)
// Since we are running this as a standalone script using ts-node or similar, we need to initialize.
// But we don't have the service account key easily accessible here maybe?
// Actually, the app uses `src/lib/firebaseAdmin.ts`. I can try to use that if I run it via `next` or similar context, but that's hard.

// Alternative: Create a temporary API route that does this update.
// This is easier.
